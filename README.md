Treehouse Project #06  
Static Node.js and Express Site  
<br>

# Overview

This project builds a portfolio site to showcase my completed work with my Full Stack TechDegree journey. It's built with NodeJs, Express Middleware and Pug templating. I've created the routes to the API needed for each view and error handling. The Pug templates are used to dynamically display each project page as well as the main site.

This portfolio contains my contact details and information about myself.
